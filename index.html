<h1>My research at University of Michigan</h1>
<p>Various graphs made for various events. In total there were 115 events my code plotted.</p>
<img src="combinedplot.png" alt="combinedplot.png">
<p>Each colored line represents an energy channel on the GOES13 satellite. The peaks are marked by stars. This plot combines the 1 day background period(yellow), with the 3 day event period(orange).</p>

<p>This graph shows the energy and flux against Energy Channel (MeVs)</p>
<img src="logscaleflux.png" alt="logscaleflux.png">
<p>This graph is similar to the previous one, but the Energy Channels are placed according to their MeV value on a log scale, so it is clear which sensors have what values.</p>

<img src="bgplot.png" alt="bgplot.png">
<p>These graphs show the event and the background for one channel.</p>
